# Detect sentence ending punctuation

The files in this folder are used to detect sentence ending punctuation in the transcripts.
The idea is to have a clear cut in the transcripts by cutting at the end of each whole sentence.
We are currently detecting the punctuation in the partial transcripts and cutting the audio by the according timestamps.
